### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. It also has a [free downloadable poster](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-get-the-poster) that sumarizes the concepts very well. 
- [Formik Tutorial](https://formik.org/docs/tutorial) - This is a great tutorial for anyone starting out with formik. I found the [reducing boilerplate section](https://formik.org/docs/tutorial#reducing-boilerplate) really helpful on how to create reusable input primitive components that can be shared around in the application.
- [A Complete Guide to Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This a very good article to understand basics of media queries.
